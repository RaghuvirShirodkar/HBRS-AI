# Informed Search 

This source code covers implementation of _A*_ and _greedy_ search algorithms for the *8 puzzle* problem.

Heuristic functions used are:
- Misplaced tiles: Number of tiles out of place in the puzzle state.
- Manhattan distance: Actual number of moves needed to reach goal state for a given tile.
