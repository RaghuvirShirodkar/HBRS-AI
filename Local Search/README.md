# Local Search

This source code covers implementation of _hill climbing_ and _simulated annealing_ local search algorithms for the *travelling sales person* problem.

Within hill climbing, two variants are being considered:
- Simple 
- Steepest ascent

All three implementations have _random restart_ enabled.
